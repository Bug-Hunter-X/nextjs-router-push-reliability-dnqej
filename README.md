# Next.js Intermittent `router.push()` Failure

This repository demonstrates a Next.js application with an intermittent issue where `router.push()` fails to redirect the user as expected after navigating between pages.

## Problem Description

The application consists of two pages: `Home` and `About`. A link on the Home page navigates to the About page, and a button on the About page is supposed to redirect back to the Home page. However, this redirect is not always successful; sometimes, the page appears to hang, and the redirect doesn't happen.  The issue appears to be linked to client-side routing behavior and is not consistent.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Start the development server using `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to the About page from the Home page.
5. Click the button to go back to the Home page.  Observe that sometimes this does not function, while other times it does.

## Solution

The solution involves checking the return value of `router.push()` and handling potential issues.

## Additional Notes

This issue might be related to various factors including client-side routing optimizations, browser caching, or inconsistencies in how Next.js handles redirects.  Further investigation might be required for a complete understanding of the root cause.
